*__"Sorted"__: British informal: dealt with satisfactorily*

Sorted is a tiny mixin for CollectionViews and CompositeViews in __[Marionette.JS](http://marionettejs.com/)__ which allows the order of the underlying collection to be maintained in the view.

## Usage

Simply mix the `SortedMixin` into your `CollectionView`-based class. This can be done using underscore's `extend` method, like this:

```
var MyCollectionView = Marionette.CollectionView.extend({
});
_.extend(MyCollectionView.prototype, SortedMixin);
```

Although personally, we prefer using [__cocktail__](https://github.com/onsi/cocktail) for mixins:

```
var MyCollectionView = Marionette.CollectionView.extend({
});
Cocktail.mixin(MyCollectionView, SortedMixin);
```

Once the mixin has been installed the collectionview will always maintain the order of the underlying collection.
